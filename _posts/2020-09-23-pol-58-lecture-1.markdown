## Use of technology in elections

- The US has over 10,000 jurisdictions, each implementing their own set of rules about how to administer the voting process

- On the one hand, carrying out electoral reform is diffcult in such a system. On the other, it makes it difficult to hack and manipulate from the outside

- A push for more technology does not work as a substitute for trust

- What should technology for elections look like? Is this technology secure enough that the loser will concede to losing the race within this system?

- For this election, fewer "neutral" foreign journalists are available to provide coverage because of the travel bans

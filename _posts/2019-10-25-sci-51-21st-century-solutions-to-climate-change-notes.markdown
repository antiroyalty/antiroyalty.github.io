*Notes from [Stanford's Continuing Studies SCI 51]class offered in Fall 2019*

### Lecture 1 - Climate Science
- Carbon -> 82% of GHGs, with a staying power of 1000ppm
- Methane -> 10 years staying power, but 21x the strength of CO2. Sources include enteric fermentation (rice, cows) (26%); landfills (18%); coal (10%)
- Nitrous oxide -> 114 years staying power, 300x the strength of CO2. Sources include synthetic fertilizer for monocrops, agriculture soil management (74%)
- [Charles David Keeling][charles david keeling] started measuring CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in 1958, identified anthropogenic contributions to the "greenhouse effect". No significant research in atmospheric CO2 concentrations prior to that. Coined the "Keeling Curve"
- No silver bullet to climate change ("why can't we just plant more trees"), will take an assortment of solutions

### Lecture 3 - Technology 
- Emissions released from airplanes is unevenly distributed, greatest emissions at take-off site
- Investments in public transit will always out-perform ridesharing
- Annual emissions per vehicle for electric vehicles is half of gas cars
- [CASB400][casb400] - electric bikes are subsidized for low-income families
- Microgrids -> Oakland eco block, retrofitted for a block of homes > 30y
- What is the future of plastic we've already made? Bacteria has evolved to eat plastic. Ideonella sakaiensis == PET eating bacteria. PET is the most ubiquitous plastic in single-use bottles
- SOLIDIA -> curing concrete can be done with CO2 instead of water. Also if we use less limestone and more clay, less delta of heat is needed. This could yield 70% fewer emissions than regular cement production.
- Drones with infrared sensors can be used to monitor drought-stressed plants. Stressed leaves reflect less NIR than a healthy leaf, although same in the green spectrum
- Using a hyperspectral camera or LiDAR for land surveying can be used to help make nature a quantifiable resource
- Policy makers need more data to legislate constraints on use of natural resources. Can't legislate what they can't measure.
- Need more ways to grasp the abstract concepts of carbon pollution and make it personal
- Many technologies, one goal - geothermal, carbon capture, storage, smart grids / micro grids, solar, regulatory. All outlined in [Drawdown][drawdown].
- Neo-liberal position on climate change: there is tech that people will pay for to fix these problems
- We have the solutions *right now* to fix this problem with minimal disruption to our economy. Why aren't we doing them?

### Lecture 4 - Policy
- Emitters are not people, they are companies. 
- Government is the mechanism by which we make collective decisions. Need to support collective action.
- All the solutions are already on the table. Science is the problem <=> Policy is the problem pendulum swing
- "I'm not afraid of what climate change will do, I'm afraid of what we'll do to each other"
- "It's about the stories, it's not about the science"

I started a stained glass class through the Berkeley Art Studio this fall.

We start by drawing a design on cardstock paper. Coloring it lightly where helpful. Numbering the pieces. Then cutting it out, overlaying the pieces on the stained glass colors of our choice. After that, we start "scoring" the glass. Just like scoring baked bread. 

One thing that I didn't expect was the feeling of walking around a kitchen with broken glass shards all the time. Ultimately it makes sense, you're intentionally breaking glass, but I hadn't put myself in the position to be doing that intentionally, maybe ever. 

It was meditative to do it. It's less precise than drawing and painting, and a lot cleaner than ceramics. Yet you also have to give yourself over to the material: each piece of glass cuts and splits differently, and has different colors and abberations. You have to give the glass somewhere to go. And to do it in a clean way that doesn't leave behind a puddle of shards is an elevated skill. 

There's no rushing it. There's no getting around it if you scored the glass poorly. You have to be strong, firm, and resolved about where you want it to be cut while you're scoring it -- everything else stems with that. If your hand wavers, or you change your mind partway through, the glass won't tolerate that - it will still break in the original way you were header, or worse, in a different way you didn't intend at all. You have to be clear with it and steer it with resolve. Take a deep breath, and follow through.

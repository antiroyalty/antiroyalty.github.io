I started a stained glass class through the Berkeley Art Studio this fall.

We start by drawing a design on cardstock paper. Coloring it lightly where helpful. Numbering the pieces. Then cutting it out, overlaying the pieces on the stained glass colors of our choice. After that, we start "scoring" the glass. Just like scoring baked bread. 

One thing that I didn't expect was the feeling of walking around a kitchen with broken glass shards all the time. Ultimately it makes sense, you're intentionally breaking glass, but I hadn't put myself in the position to be doing that intentionally, maybe ever. 

It was meditative to do it. It's less precise than drawing and painting, and a lot cleaner than ceramics. Yet you also have to give yourself over to the material: each piece of glass cuts and splits differently, and has different colors and abberations. You have to give the glass somewhere to go. And to do it in a clean way that doesn't leave behind a puddle of shards is an elevated skill. 

There's no rushing it. There's no getting around it if you scored the glass poorly. You have to be strong, firm, and resolved about where you want it to be cut while you're scoring it -- everything else stems with that. If your hand wavers, or you change your mind partway through, the glass won't tolerate that - it will still break in the original way you were header, or worse, in a different way you didn't intend at all. You have to be clear with it and steer it with resolve. Take a deep breath, and follow through.

List of materials:
- Stained glass: 
- Gas mask:
- Glass cutter
- Glass splitter
- Dimond cutter / sander
- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Steel wool

The first step is to draw the design you are interested in. With some constraints. First set of constraints: max length and width dimensions. Both for drawing purposes (what's the piece of paper size) and the max glass sheet purpose. Second set of constraints: Nothing too sharp, nothing too pointy, nothing that converges or diverges at too big of an angle. I'll explain in a moment. Basically, the name of the game with making anything curved with stained glass is called "inner curves". You can think of inner curves as the crescent shape of the moon -- in the clsasic picture of the moon with a face, it is the inside part of the moon curve, where the face is. And, in most cases, if the "curve" slope is as steep as the inner curve of the moon, you will probably have a lot of trouble making this in a single stained glass piece.

Why? Let's review -- glass needs somewhere to break, and it generally breaks in a straight line. When we cut glass, we can't do what we do with scissors: make an incision partway into the paper, and then pull back and start again. You have to make an incision *all the way through* from one end of the glass sheet to another, when you cut glass. You can't redirect it, because then the materials science part of glass will ensure that it gets "confused" and still breaks in the same direction as you were originally going. (Work on describing this better). But, basically, you can see that if you try to do an inner curve, if it's too curved, you risk the fact that the glass might "choose" or "prefer" (to personify this beautiful thing) to break straight down the dominant line, rather than following the steepest part of the angle to "redirect" the breakage. Thus you may end up with your steep curve being a piece that is split into two. But, potentially, not in the way that you'd hoped.

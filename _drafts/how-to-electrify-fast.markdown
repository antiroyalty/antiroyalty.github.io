There's a disonnance in our conversation about decarbonization I can't seem to shake. On the one hand, we need to have decarbonized "yesterday". Most of our climate models rely on negative emissions tech to stay below / within warming threshholds, and without these technologies, staying below really terrible global temperature averages is impossible. However, as you can see, we don't really have negative emission tech really working yet. This means that if we want to stand any reasonable chance (avoiding needing a deus-ex-mahinus) at not boiling to death, we need to stop putting carbon into the atmosphere *right now*.

On the other hand, the work to decarbonize has been, let's just say, sluggish. We've known these facts for years if not decades, and we've even made improvements to technologies, and yet we get ourselves bogged down with costs, optimalities, policy proceedures, and equity programs to do it in "just the right way". When really, what we need to do is to do this as fast as possible. 

What would be the fastest way to get widespread electrification in California?

Remove the bottlenecks that slow grid hookups, make new electric loads flexible by default, and scale supply + wires in parallel.

1) Slash time to connect new electric load from months to weeks.
- Connection queue triage: use LLMs to normalize customer applications, auto-check for missing info, route jobs by complexity, and publish live timelines
- SB 410


2) Build the wires California has already planned, but faster

3) Lock in the demand growth that is flexible by default.

4) Scale end-uses that the state has already targeted

5) Keep supply clean, and expanding in parallel

6) Improve first-pass modeling appraoches
- DeepOPF
- Deploy fast power-flow / hosting-capacity surrogates to screen EV / heat pump clusters and pre-approve standard upgrades so that most projects can skip interconnection paperwork

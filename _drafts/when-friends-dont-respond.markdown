I found myself feeling anxious this week when a few friends didn't respond. We're 30 years old, at that age that is a crossroads for so many people. And similarly at times, I find myself holding my breath for who will still be there on the other side of it. I want to understand what is going on in each loved ones life, so I could minimize the chances of being blindsided by their sudden change of plans and a departure.

Over the years I've started to be protective of friendships more than I ever was when I was younger - specifically, protective about their longevity.

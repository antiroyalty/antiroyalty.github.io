## About

Hi — I'm Ana. I build software and explore energy modeling. This site is a working notebook: short notes, experiments, and project logs.

If you're new here:

- Browse [Projects](/projects/) for a curated selection of things I’ve built.
- Read [Writing](/writing/) for essays, notes, and snippets.
- Sign the [Guestbook](/guestbook/) to say hello.
